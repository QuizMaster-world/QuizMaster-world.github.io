<h2> Other Versions of QuizMaster </h2>

<p>
While the original QuizMaster app is by far the most feature-rich and aesthetically pleasing option, there are several alternative versions tailored for different use cases and user preferences. All of these versions are organized under <a href="//github.com/QuizMaster-world">the QuizMaster Organisation</a>, providing quick accessibility to all. Below is a brief overview of each version:
</p>
<ul>

 <li>QuizMasterLite is the first lighter version of the QuizMaster App, designed for users who need the core functionality of QuizMaster without the additional "frills" that increase size and complexity. While still using the same GUI framework, QuizMasterLite focuses on retaining the essential quiz creation and playing capabilities, ensuring that users can still enjoy a seamless and engaging experience while benefiting from a significantly smaller application footprint.</li>
 
 <li>QuizMasterMini: This scaled-down version is designed for use on smaller devices or for users who may have budgetary constraints regarding data volumes. Despite using a lighter GUI, it retains many of the core functionalities, making it a suitable alternative for those who need a simpler interface without sacrificing key features.</li>

 <li>QuizMasterTerminal: A minimalist iteration of QuizMaster, QuizMasterTerminal uses a TUI rather than a GUI. While QuizMasterTerminal does not have a graphical window, interaction are still kept streamlined through a sleek new TUI window.</li>

 <li>MicroQuizMaster: As the lightest version of all QuizMasters, MicroQuizMaster is a mere 8 KB in size. Unlike QuizMasterTerminal, it does not use a TUI or include any example quizzes, focusing instead on ultra-lightweight functionality for users with the lowest-specification devices. It is <i>particularly</i> aimed at <strong>Windows</strong> users or those seeking a no-frills experience with minimal resource consumption.</li>

 <li>QuizMasterPaper offers a printable version of quizzes that can be used in offline or classroom settings, given in either <code>PDF</code> or <code>TXT</code> format. Unlike the other repositories, QuizMasterPaper does not have quiz playing functionality but the quizcreator can still read the json format present in other repos.</li>

 <li>QuizMaster-web: Currently still in the early stages of development, QuizMaster-web aims to bring the QuizMaster experience to web browsers. This version is expected to provide a more versatile and accessible web-based application of the QuizMaster app, allowing users to engage with quizzes directly in their browsers without requiring any downloads or installations.</li>
</ul>

Each version of QuizMaster caters to specific needs and environments, ensuring that users can find an appropriate solution that matches their capabilities and preferences.
