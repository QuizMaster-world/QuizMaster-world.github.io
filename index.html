<h1> The world of QuizMaster</h1>

Welcome to QuizMaster World.
<p>
QuizMaster World is the organisation that develops the QuizMaster game, a free and open source software for everyone to enjoy.

There is an active and friendly community developing multiple variants of QuizMaster, and creating new quizzes.
</p>
<p>
Pull requests, for code contributions as well as new quizzes are welcome. It's a fun and easy entry to the pleasure of open source software development in a team.
</p>

<h2> Getting a new quiz integrated</h2>
<p>
  Use QuizCreator to make a new quiz. All wrong answers (maximum 9) entered into the text field for wrong answers must be separated by a comma. Save the quiz as file with extension `.json` in the data folder, commit to your branch of the repository, push to github and make a pull request to the master branch.
  QuizMaster World is actively working on an even more convenient way of getting new quizzes in - not requiring learning how to use version control system git or the github platform. 
  Consider using git, as this gives credit to the contributor.
