<p>
QuizMaster World is the organisation that develops the QuizMaster game, a free and open source software for everyone to enjoy.

</p>
  
<p>
We have an active and friendly community committed to enhancing the QuizMaster experience. This community works tirelessly to develop multiple variants of the QuizMaster game and to create and curate new quizzes that cover a wide array of topics. Everyone is encouraged to participate, share their creativity, and contribute to the growing library of quizzes.
</p>
  
<p>
We welcome pull requests for both code contributions and the creation of new quizzes. Joining our community is not only enjoyable but provides a fun and easy entry point into the rewarding world of open-source software development within a collaborative team setting.</p>

<h2> Getting a new quiz integrated</h2>
<p>
  Use QuizCreator to make a new quiz. All wrong answers (maximum 9) entered into the text field for wrong answers must be separated by a comma. Save the quiz as file with extension `.json` in the data folder, commit to your branch of the repository, push to github and make a pull request to the master branch.
</p>

<p>
  We are currently working on an even more convenient way to integrate new quizzes that won't require contributors to learn version control systems like Git or the GitHub platform. However, we highly encourage using Git, as this not only makes contributions more organized but also gives credit to the contributor, ensuring that your effort is recognized within our community.
