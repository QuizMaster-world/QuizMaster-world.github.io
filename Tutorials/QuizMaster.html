    <h1>A Basic QuizMaster Tutorial</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this QuizMaster tutorial! The guide will help you understand how to use key features of the QuizMaster application, an open-source alternative to Kahoot. Please note that this guide explains how to use QuizMaster, not how to get it running. For this, we have created a seperate <a href="Tutorials/QuizMasterInstallation.html">installation and troubleshooting guide</a>. QuizMaster is written in Python and provides a powerful platform for creating and playing educational quizzes.</p>

          <p>QuizMaster supports a wide range of game modes, categorized into two main types:</p>

          <h2 id="creating-a-quiz">Creating a Quiz</h2>
          <p>To create a new quiz, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Click on <strong>Make a Quiz</strong> from the home screen or start it manually via terminal.</li>
              <li>Enter the quiz title</li>
              <li>Add questions by clicking on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li>
              <li>For each question, enter the question text, correct answer, and a set of incorrect answers separated by commas.</li>
              <li>Save the quiz once all questions have been added. Use the <strong>Save As</strong> function from <code>Files</code> in the top left if creating an entirely new quiz, otherwise <strong>Save</strong> (just above <code>Save As</code>) will suffice.</li>
          </ol>
          <img src="../images/QM2.png" alt="Quiz Creator">
          <p>Use the interactive GUI to manage and create quiz questions. You can add, edit, delete and duplicate questions. Many of these will have tooltips, so should be self-explanitory.</p>
          <p>Make sure to provide clear and correct questions and answers to ensure a good quiz experience.</p>
          <p>
              We welcome pull requests for both code contributions and the creation of new quizzes.</p>

              <h2> Getting a new quiz integrated</h2>
             Once you have saved the quiz as file with extension `.json` in the data folder, commit to your branch of the repository, push to github and make a pull request to the main branch.
              </p>

              <p>
                We are currently working on an even more convenient way to integrate new quizzes that won't require contributors to learn version control systems like Git or the GitHub platform. However, we highly encourage using Git, as this not only makes contributions more organized but also gives credit to the contributor, ensuring that your effort is recognized within our community.
              </p>


            <h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
            <p>In the preferences window, you can change the background music, volume, and background colour of the application:</p>
            <img src="../images/QM5.png" alt="Preferences">
            <p>Adjust the settings to personalize your QuizMaster experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Music</strong>: Choose from a selection of background music tracks to play during your quiz sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume</strong>: Adjust the volume of the background music to your liking.</li>
                <li><strong>Background Colour</strong>: Customize the background colour of the application to create a comfortable visual experience. It uses RGB so you need to determine how much of each colour to add to the screen. If the sliders are all the way to the left the screen will be black. Vice versa, white. Currently it does not update automatically, so do not worry if nothing happens. This is a bug that will soon be fixed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="arguments">Using Arguments</h2>
        <p>The <code>quiz.py</code> script accepts the following arguments when starting:</p>    
        <ul>
            <li><code>-h, --help</code>: Displays the help message and exits.</li>
            <li><code>-q [QUIZPATH], --quizPath [QUIZPATH]</code>: Specifies the path to a quiz file. This allows you to load a specific quiz to play.</li>
            <li><code>-g [GAMEMODE], --gameMode [GAMEMODE]</code>: Specifies the game mode. The available game modes are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>classic</code></li>
                    <li><code>classicV2</code></li>
                    <li><code>speedRun</code></li>
                    <li><code>survival</code></li>
                    <li><code>practice</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>-v , --volume</code>: Sets the volume level for the game. Enter a float value between 0 and 1.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <h3>Example 1: Load a Specific Quiz</h3>
        <p>To load a specific quiz, use the <code>-q</code> argument followed by the path to the quiz file:</p>
        <pre><code>./quiz.py -q path/to/quiz.json</code></pre>
    
        <h3>Example 2: Set the Game Mode</h3>
        <p>To set the game mode, use the <code>-g</code> argument followed by the desired game mode:</p>
        <pre><code>./quiz.py -q path/to/quiz.json -g classic</code></pre>
        <p><i>Note that the quiz path must be specified along with the game mode.</i></p>
    
        <h3>Example 3: Set the Volume Level</h3>
        <p>To set the volume level, use the <code>-v</code> argument followed by a float value between 0 and 1:</p>
        <pre><code>./quiz.py -v 0.5</code></pre>
    
        <h3>Example 4: Combine Arguments</h3>
        <p>You can combine multiple arguments when running the script. For example, loading a harry potter quiz with the classic game mode and set the volume to 0.8:</p>
        <pre><code>./quiz.py -q "Quizzes/books and movies/harrypotter.json" -g classic -v 0.8</code></pre>

        <p>The arguments may be combined in any other way, except that the quiz must be specified for the game mode argument to be given. This may be worked on in the future.</p>
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>By using these arguments, you can customize your QuizMaster experience to suit your preferences.</p>
        
        <h6>Game Mode Options</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>classic</li>
        <li>classicV2</li>
        <li>speedRun</li>
        <li>survival</li>
        <li>practice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Similarly in QuizCreator, a quiz parameter can be added to the end but for obvious reasons not a game mode parameter.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Explore these features to get the most out of your QuizMaster experience. Whether you're playing for fun or using it as an educational tool, QuizMaster offers a variety of options to suit your needs.</p>
